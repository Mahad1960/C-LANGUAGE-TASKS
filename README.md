# C Programming – University Assignments:

This repository contains multiple C programming tasks and assignments completed as part of my coursework at university. These assignments cover a wide range of fundamental concepts in C, including data structures, algorithms, file handling, pointer manipulation, and more.

Purpose:

These tasks were designed to strengthen core programming logic, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills in C — a foundational language for systems programming and computer science.

Topics Covered:

Some of the major topics covered across the assignments include:

- Variables and Data Types
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Arrays (1D, 2D)
- Strings and String Functions
- Functions (User-defined, Recursive)
- Structures and Unions
- Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation
- File Handling
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Menu-Driven Programs
- Mini Projects (Available on another repository)
